# Stationeering Systems IC10 Library

> Note: This project is unaffiliated with [stationeering.com](https://stationeering.com) or other external Stationeers initiatives.  All systems and documentation are independently developed and focused on modular, resilient IC10-based control for advanced infrastructure design.

## Overview
The Stationeering Systems IC10 Library is a multi-repository engineering archive dedicated to system design and automation for **Stationeers**.  Each repository corresponds to a planetary environment and operational tier, and includes:

* Deployment-ready IC10 scripts
* Operations manuals and readiness checklists
* Modular subsystems for station integration

All systems are designed with a focus on reliability, maintainability, and engineering clarity, serving as a practical reference for solo and multi-crew operations alike.

> For stategic theory, deployment rationale, and system walkthroughs, see the [Stationeering Systems Substack](https://stationeering.substack.com), the primary source of in-world documentation and engineering commentary.

## Repository Organization
Each repository in this organization is scoped to a specific planetary environment, starting condition, and difficulty tier.  This structure allows systems to be tailored to the constraints, resources, and progression unique to each scenario.  
Modules within a repository are grouped by functional domain--atmospherics, power, life support, and more--and may include both IC10 control code and accompanying documentation.
> Not all modules include control code.  Some are specification-only and are documented exclusively through the [Stationeering Systems Substack](https://stationeering.substack.com)

## Getting Started
Visit any repository to explore its system layout, control logic, and technical documentation.  IC10 scripts are formatted for **direct copy into in-game consoles** or use with tools like the [Stationeers Code Simulator](ic10.dev).

## Contributing
This project reflects the work of a solo engineer, supported by the Stationeering Systems writing partner AI.  Community contributions are welcome via pull requests, issues, or direct feedback--particularly for code improvements, edge-case handling, or cross-environment compatibility.
